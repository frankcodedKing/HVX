         <strong> Disciplined and Active Portfolio Management</strong> <br>
We’re more than just stock pickers. We believe active portfolio management centered on your long-term goals is the best way to discover opportunities and achieve long-term results. Our five-person Investment Policy Committee, supported by a large in-house research staff, analyzes global investing opportunities narrowing down from country and sector to find securities they think will do well moving forward. This disciplined approach allows us to interpret information differently and find global investing opportunities other money managers may overlook.
